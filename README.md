Laravel-like helpers

I am a BIG BIG fan of Laravel framework. I used Laravel for some of my projects. I liked how it was created that's why I'm enjoyed using Laravel framework. BUT in some other cases, there are projects framework is not recommended to use and the best example for that is background services like parsers, synchronizer or web services. Those background services are being develop by procedural programming or very straight forward BUT I HATE procedural coding or what do we called SPAGHETTI code. I hate unstructured coding! But I admit that before, I am also a procedural programmer and my codes are very unstructured! and I hate to see my previous codings. Hehehe. But when I learned how OOP(Object Oriented Programming) works and learned to use Laravel framework, I started to enjoy Object Oriented Programming and I am practicing it through my projects.  That's why I created my own Laravel-like helpers/libraries/utilities and the ideas is from Laravel.

You can also use this if you want to try OOP or you want to make your coding so much easier if you're not using any framework.
I Will create a drupal module that will implement this helper soon  :smile:
